                        <p>
                            I'm frightened by the infinity of the world<br>
                            I'm scared of what comes after death<br>
                            Is there anything at all?<br>
                            Or just our bodies left in a mess<br>
                            <br>
                            Some thoughts are fleeting and don't hurt the soul<br>
                            Some are parasites<br>
                            And when you see the man in a suit, and he's tall<br>
                            There's only hope for the light<br>
                            <br>
                            Last night I had a dream<br>
                            I was insane in it<br>
                            It has its plans on me<br>
                            I was captured<br>
                            In my own mind, again<br>
                            <br>
                            When I was sleeping<br>
                            It terrified me again<br>
                            There was a vision<br>
                            Of how the war begins<br>
                            Missiles were chasing each other<br>
                            To defend or kill<br>
                            <br>
                            Last night I had a dream<br>
                            Adventures I was involved<br>
                            It forces me to take a role<br>
                            In his fiction<br>
                            How it's told, willfully<br>
                            Do I own this dream, or it owns me?<br>
                            <br>
                            His shadow follows me<br>
                            It cannot catch me up<br>
                            But it will chase me in both worlds<br>
                            There's nowhere I can hide<br>
                            He is constructor of my dreams<br>
                            Combining frames for me to see<br>
                            He takes my feelings and my thoughts<br>
                            And turns them into sights<br>
                            <br>
                            Then the morning will set me free<br>
                            From my horror of the night<br>
                            But I'll be crushed by his terror<br>
                            I can not stand this fight<br>
                            <br>
                            You think of dreams as mellow<br>
                            Fairy tail to protect you from the darkness<br>
                            But mine is not that narrow<br>
                            It has its means to torture me, repeatedly.<br>
                            <br>
                            This time I will try to make a guess<br>
                            How long will it keep me in the cell<br>
                            Never will I want to be a guest<br>
                            In a story that he tells<br>

                            Who burnt the baby<br>
                            While I was the only one to save him<br>
                            Nobody cared then<br>
                            Who even left him waiting?<br>
                            Near running gas spouts<br>
                            Under no surveillance<br>
                            Now you blame me for it<br>
                            <br>
                            I didn't even know about his presence <br>
                            The baby left alone, just abandoned<br>
                            I didn't even see the fire that raises<br>
                            it's been you who left him waiting<br>
                            Near running gas spouts<br>
                            Under no surveillance<br>
                            <br>
                            A group of people, other room<br>
                            They put some tests on<br>
                            Cigarettes <br>
                            I asked what they would test it for?<br>
                            They didn't even know the answer<br>
                            <br>
                            Water, I need some water<br>
                            Can't get enough of it<br>
                            In this state, I'm searching<br>
                            For a drink<br>
                            And out of closet something round is fell from<br>
                            Why someone's hiding this<br>

                            And you were a pleader<br>
                            Stolen heart with a chest wide open<br>
                            Now, I'm the lead, but not the leader <br>

                            It was a room with round dimmed windows<br>
                            Filled with hypnotic scents <br>
                            Divided by two in the middle <br>
                            Arc below the step<br>
                            <br>
                            There wasn't such thing as panic<br>
                            But it was still alarming<br>
                            <br>
                            I'm not sure if there's an option<br>
                            To turn back and go away<br>
                            He takes control over my body<br>
                            Just manipulates<br>
                            And treats me like I am a puppet<br>
                            Nothing I can contrapose<br>
                            The air war sedative, inviting us to lay<br>
                            <br>
                            we feel down to a sleep 
                            in the farthest 
                            half of the room 
                            on the beds
                            under the arc
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            When I woke up, it was already dark outside<br>
                            A faint moonbeam danced upon the chamber's wall<br>
                            On blanket white that swallowed me robustly tight<br>
                            I lost my voice, it has diminished into moan<br>
                            <br>
                            The ghost approached<br>
                            A paranormal floating blob<br>
                            He took my soul<br>                        
                            <br>
                            With a grin, it vanished from sight,
                            Leaving behind a trail of a fright.
                            let the darkness recede, let dawn's rays glow,
                            In the morning light, we'll overthrow.

                        <h4>Chapter 1 - THE TRAM</h4>
                        <p>
                            Tram rattled on, groaning beast
                            Taking me who knows where
                            Mind is a canvas so blank
                            Devoid of memories

                            Tram rattled on, groaning beast
                            Into the windows I stare
                            Outside, the world drowns in haze
                            Houses diving in a mist

                            Next stop I will disembark
                            It's time for me to move on
                            Realm that's dramatically pale
                            Accepting me to go in

                            Roaming in fields filled with mud
                            Surrounded by wind's cryptic tone 
                            Confused, I proceed in this maze
                            Coming across a high wall

                            Rising upon to the top
                            Following its narrow path
                            Minutes of walking atop
                            Unbeatable barrier appears
                        </p>
                        <h4>Chapter 2 - THE HALL</h4>
                        <p>                            
                            Shadows materialized
                            Into a female figure
                            Pointing below at the room
                            Open-air place, her invite

                            Over the fence, I comply
                            Landing down into a couch
                            Some kind of lounge, I assume
                            A shelter for any lost soul

                            Next we proceed to the hall
                            A long sequence of quirky doors
                            I reached out, pulling her close
                            “Will you love me?” - then she asks

                            Moving through this corridor
                            Frames represent puzzle pieces 
                            This kind of place nothing describes
                            Except for one chilling detail
                        </p>
                        <h4>Charter 3 - THE DARK STRANGERS</h4>
                        <p>
                            Dining guests sat in a batch
                            Faces full of hollowness 
                            Two figures roamed among them
                            A stranger with his perfect match

                            The beast in the size of a man
                            Maw leaked in a crimson cascade
                            Person himself in a cloak
                            His stories were out of sense

                            Hoping to slip outside
                            I'm heading towards an exit
                            The figure appears in my way
                            Catching my palm with his hands

                            Ruthless claws of this rogue
                            Caused a tide of a searing pain
                            I ripped my hand free and escaped
                            Paying with blood in expense
                            
                            A sprawl of the places alike
                            Chaotically stretched before me
                            My hand represents a despair,
                            A reminder of latest events
                            “Will you love me?” - I pronounced
                            The question hung in the white dense air                    
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When I'm sitting all alone, I'm crying<br>
                            Cause I want another soul around<br>
                            All my troubles are laid out on floor<br>
                            I play them like a puzzle game<br>
                            <br>
                            to fall asleep, close your eyes<br>
                            <br>
                            I've seen the stories of my life, I never<br>
                            never had in real life, I mean<br>
                            It's automated fiction from my brain<br>
                            Issued under common night<br>
                            <br>
                            it can offer pleasant journeys often<br>
                            however, silly shows occur at times<br>
                            they can be annoying enough to wake me<br>
                            So I then say myself<br>
                            <br>
                            to fall asleep, close your eyes<br>
                            <br>
                            then it's turning into a kind of pursuit<br>
                            of the peaceful state to be achieved<br>
                            but my threshold's down and noisy neighbors <br>
                            hassle me, so I'll repeat, again<br>
                            <br>
                            to fall asleep, close your eyes<br>
                            <br>
                            When I'm being on my own I'm dying<br>
                            All those fables in my mind are useless<br>
                            They trick me, they hypnotize me<br>
                            I will fight till the end <br>
                            Cause I don't want to pass the control to them<br>
                            Even though they will never retreat<br>
                            I'm not giving up<br>
